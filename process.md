# Day 1
During day 1 I worked on creating the initial proposal

# Day 2
On day 2 I was very tired and didn't accomplish very much.

# Day 3
On day 3 I finished the first version of the design document and made a small
start on working on the app itself.

# Day 4
On day 4 I started working on implementing music playback. I started following
this tutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-music-player-on-android-project-setup--mobile-22764

# Day 5
I continued working on following the tutorial and implementing music playback.
The tutorial is a great help but I needed to figure out how to adapt it's contents
to fragments.

# Day 6
The start of week 2. I messed around with fragments some more, I created a tabbed activity
through one of Android Studio's defaults but I'm now figuring out how to actually use it.

# Day 7
I put off fragments for later, it's more important to get music playback working first.
The first screen works and shows songs. Today I started part 2 of the tutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-music-player-on-android-song-playback--mobile-22778
This part focuses on music playback and writing a service.

# Day 8
I continued following the tutorial and working on music playback

# Day 9 
Unfortunately the alarm that I was expecting to wake me up was never set.
I continued working on the playback part. Pressing play shows no errors, but no sound either.
Let the debugging commence!

# Day 10
